    <h1>Privacy Policy for “Who’s Buying”</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 18 September 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how the “Who’s Buying” mobile application (the “App”), published by Digital Life Services Online (“we”, “us”, “our”), collects, uses, and protects information when you use it.
    </p>

    <h2>1. About the App</h2>
    <p>
      “Who’s Buying” helps private groups decide who will make a purchase or perform a task. You can create groups and participants, spin a roulette wheel, and review past spins.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User-entered data:</strong> Group names, participant names, and spin history you create inside the App. This information is stored locally on your device and never sent to our servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising data:</strong> The App uses Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to display interstitial ads. The AdMob SDK may collect device identifiers such as the Advertising ID, approximate location, and engagement metrics to serve and measure ads. We do not receive this information.</li>
      <li>We do not require account registration, collect contact information, or access data outside the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Local group and spin data remain only on your device as long as you keep it there.</li>
      <li>Advertising-related data is processed by Google (AdMob) for ad delivery, performance measurement, and reporting.</li>
      <li>We do not sell or share personal data with third parties beyond the App’s integration with AdMob.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can delete groups or history directly in the App at any time.</li>
      <li>You can reset your Advertising ID or opt out of personalized ads in your device settings.</li>
      <li>Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date and publish the new policy at this URL. Continued use of the App after changes are posted signifies your acceptance of the updated terms.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
